# Quantization_matmul

This was a task to accelerate the second fully connected layer for the mnist data set. 
The matrix multiplication HW was synthesized using the HLS code. The core topic of this task is quantization. 
The accuracy and HW resource usage were compared while quantizing the activation and weight with various bit numbers.
It is a team project, but due to the team members' circumstances, my contribution is 100%.
